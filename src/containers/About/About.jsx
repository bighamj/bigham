            <strong>Patent</strong> - "Laser Projection System" US-11988889-B2,
            US20210149144-A1 Â· A light projector and method of aligning the
            light projector is provided. A light projector steers an outgoing
            beam of light onto an object, passing light returned from the object
            through a focusing lens onto an optical detector. The light
            projector may generate a light pattern or template by rapidly moving
            the outgoing beam of light along a path on a surface. To place the
            light pattern/template in a desired location, the light projector
            may be aligned with an electronic model.
